Ham radio ops who like QRP will sooner or later want to learn Morse code so they 
can communicate using CW. This app teaches not only amateur radio enthusiasts 
how Morse code works and trains practitioners so they get faster.

You set your current level of proficiency and what you aim for (e.g. all letters 
with 20 words per minute). Dahdidahdit guides you from where you are to where 
to want to be: it teaches you new letters when you are ready and increases your 
speed when you seem bored. The only things you need other than a phone and the 
app is a sheet of paper and a pen. When you start the session, Dahdidahdit
plays Morse code letters you know at the speed you are comfortable with. You jot 
down the letters you recognized. When the session ends, Dahdidahdit shows you 
what it sent and you compare notes. Then you tap the button that shows the 
proper number of mistakes. When you complete enough practice sessions with only 
few mistakes, Dahdidahdit starts the next lesson - be it by introducing a new 
letter or by increasing the speed.

Other features include learning Q-code and sending practice using either an 
on-screen or an actual paddle, connected by USB.
